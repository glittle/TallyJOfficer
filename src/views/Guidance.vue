    <h1>General Guidance</h1>

    <em>If All Members Present, Permanent Officers Should Be Elected Immediately</em>
    <p>While it is certainly true that the permanent officers of an Assembly should be elected immediately following the election of that Assembly, it is equally important, as stated in Article IV of the By-laws of the National Assembly, that 'The officers shall be elected by a majority vote of the entire membership of the Assembly taken by secret ballot.' That is all members of the Assembly must be properly notified and given an opportunity to vote, and in cases of unavoidable absence it does not contravene the spirit of the By-laws if the absent member should cast his ballot by mail or even by telephone.</p>
    <p>Temporary officers may be elected until all nine are properly notified of the election.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly, July 27, 1981)</cite>

    <p>Q. In voting for officers is it permissible to read the names of those persons who have tied?</p>
    <p>A. When voting for officers of an Assembly a result is only reached when one member receives five or more votes. Until that result is reached all members are eligible for the office in question and the results of all inconclusive ballots should be made known to the meeting."</p>
    <cite>(From a letter of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, July 29, 1971)</cite>

    <p>The complete results of each vote should be known to all members of the Assembly. Therefore, the names and tally should be given by the tellers, and if no member has received the required majority, the members should proceed to vote again. Voting should not be confined to those receiving the highest number of votes.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, August 4, 1981: cited in a letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of Mexico, September 2, 1981)</cite>
    
    <em>The Integrity of the Elector Must Be Relied Upon</em>
    <p>You will note in the above extract that the tellers should report both names and tally. The House of Justice suggests that we must rely on the integrity of the elector to consider dispassionately those names he lists on his ballot, irrespective of the results of the previous balloting.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Mexico, September 2, 1981)</cite>
    
    <p>Any officer elected must have received at least five votes, even if only five members are present. The ballots of any absentee members cannot be counted if re-voting is necessary. If for any reason no member receives five votes, then the Assembly must in consultation appoint one or more temporary officers to function until the next meeting, and must call another meeting as soon as possible to elect permanent officers.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 26 September 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a Local Spiritual Assembly)</cite>

    <em>Assembly or Committee Members May Excuse Themselves from Being Elected as Officers</em>
    <p>
      We have also been asked to point out that although it is the obligation of a Bahá'í to serve on an Assembly,
      either Local or National, when elected, on several occasions the beloved Guardian pointed out that before
      the election of officers, if any member had a good reason in his own opinion why he should not be elected
      to one of the offices of the Assembly, he was free to suggest that he should not be so elected.
      The House of Justice also feels that as the work of the Faith expands and the duties of officers,
      particularly on National Spiritual Assemblies, acquire more importance, it is permissible and at times
      advisable to discuss the duties incumbent upon and required of each officer before ballots are cast.
    </p>
    <cite>(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, February 9, 1987)</cite>
    
    <em>It is Preferable that a Person Hold No More Than One Office</em>
    <p>...we are asked to say it is preferable that a person hold no more than one office, but it is within the discretion of your Assembly to permit a member to hold two offices.</p>
    <p>Regarding the specific instance you have cited, you should consider carefully whether one person can effectively perform as both Chairman and Secretary, given the requirements of each office.</p>

    <h1>Officers of an Assembly</h1>
    <a name="chair">&nbsp;</a>
    <h2>The Chairman &amp; Vice-Chairman</h2>
    <p>Concerning the duties of the Chairman of the Local Spiritual Assembly or the National Spiritual Assembly: He is supposed to share, freely and fully, in the discussions of all subjects under the consideration of these bodies, and to register his vote regarding each one of them. The duty of a Bahá’í Chairman is not only to guide the course of the discussion, but also to express his own viewpoint without any reservation whatever. He is entitled to exercise both of these functions.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 10 October 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</cite>
    <p>In regards to the Assembly meeting, the Chair has the responsibility to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that there is free and open discussion during the meetings, that it is kept to the point, and that all members are given the opportunity to contribute to the consultation</li>
      <li>Clarify decisions or motions so that they are fully understood and can be accurately recorded in the minutes</li>
      <li>Call for a vote when appropriate</li>
      <li>Consult with Secretary about agenda</li>
      <li>Call the meeting to order</li>
    </ul>
    <cite>(From Developing Distinctive Bahá’í Communities: Guidelines for Spiritual Assemblies, 1998)</cite>
    <p>The Universal House of Justice has asked us to advise you that the appropriate procedure would be for the Vice-Chairman of the Assembly to chair the meetings in the absence of the Chairman. If the Vice-Chairman happens to be also absent, then the Assembly should decide who among the members present should chair the meeting.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 10 February 1987 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</cite>

    <a name="secretary">&nbsp;</a>

    <h2>The Secretary &amp; Assistant Secretaries</h2>
    <p>The proper growth of a community is possible only when the National Spiritual Assembly, through its office and secretary, is able to maintain a steady flow of communication to the believers in its jurisdiction, offering guidance and encouragement to them. Every effort should be made to enable the National Assembly secretary to discharge his or her duties without being hampered by too many administrative regulations. The manner in which this is done, of course, is left to the discretion of each National Spiritual Assembly.</p>
    <p>A key factor in determining how much responsibility is to be placed on the secretary is trust. When there is trust and love among the members of the Assembly, many problems will be avoided. The National Assembly secretary should be empowered to take the initiative in matters of a routine nature. It is not normally necessary for the secretary's letters to be scrutinized by other members of the Assembly although they may always have access to such correspondence.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 21 September 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</cite>
    <p>Whatever the personal circumstances of the believer employed, the National Assembly should realize that its Secretary is its chief executive officer, and as such acts not only as liaison with the national committees, the Local Spiritual Assemblies and all the friends, but generally represents the National Spiritual Assembly and the Faith itself to the non-Bahá'í world, a duty becoming ever more important as the Cause becomes more widely known.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 23 January 1981 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</cite>
    <em>Full-Time Services of Secretary May Require Remuneration, about which the Agreement Should Be Duly Recorded</em>
    <p>A national Bahá'í community which reaches that stage of development where the work of its National Spiritual Assembly requires the full-time services of its Secretary, faces many difficult, and sometimes delicate, considerations. It is generally a thought-provoking occasion to the community itself, which has become used to the work of the Cause being discharged by voluntary, dedicated, part-time and often amateur service; and the realization that the Cause has reached the point where its work and public image--so important to future progress--can no longer be maintained in the old way, may be disturbing at first. The friends, however, quickly respond to the new capacity for leadership and guidance and the increased status which its National Assembly acquires by establishing a sounder foundation for its operations, and are encouraged by the advancement of the Cause.</p>
    <p>The specific remuneration and conditions of service of the national Secretary must obviously be the result of consultation, and when agreement has been reached the result should be recorded, not necessarily in a contract, but certainly in a Minute of the Assembly and/or an exchange of letters.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 23 January 1981 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</cite>
    <p>Generally speaking the Secretary of an Assembly must be careful to convey exactly what the majority decision or advice of the body was. There can surely be no objection to his putting it in proper terms and clarifying the matter according to the decisions or instruction of the Assembly. But he should of course not introduce his personal views unless endorsed by the Assembly.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 19 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, published in Unfolding Destiny)</cite>
    <p>Generally, the functions of the Secretary include the following, although the Assembly is free to assign some of the responsibilities to secretarial assistants or other members. Some larger communities have found it is helpful to divide the workload of their Secretariats. For example, they may have a General Secretary, an External Affairs Secretary, a Recording Secretary and a Personal Status Secretary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepares agenda for the Assembly meetings, usually in consultation with the Chair</li>
      <li>Records all minutes of the Assembly meetings and of the annual meeting</li>
      <li>Receives mail for the Assembly and presents communications of all kinds to the Local Spiritual Assembly at the next meeting</li>
      <li>Answers correspondence, under the direction of the Local Spiritual Assembly</li>
      <li>Maintains a filing system for all correspondence, community bulletins, and so on</li>
      <li>Prepares agenda and materials to be shared with or distributed to the community at Nineteen Day Feasts</li>
      <li>Makes notes of recommendations made at the Nineteen Day Feast and presents them to the Assembly at the next meeting. The community should be advised of any action taken or consideration given to such recommendations.</li>
      <li>Maintains an up–to–date list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all members of the community</li>
      <li>Advises the Bahá’í National Center of all enrollments, transfers, changes of address, and changes in personal status of the believers (marriage, divorce)</li>
      <li>Sends out written notices of the Annual Meeting so that they are received at least fifteen days before the annual meeting on April 20th</li>
      <li>Follows up Assembly action</li>
      <li>Is watchful for the periodic submission of reports from committees as well as expected responses to the Assembly’s communications</li>
      <li>Brings to the meeting files, correspondence, and references from the Writings which relate to the meeting’s agenda</li>
    </ul>
    <cite>(From Developing Distinctive Bahá’í Communities: Guidelines for Spiritual Assemblies, 1998)</cite>

    <p>The duties of the Secretary may be divided among more than one person. For example, the Assembly may elect a Recording Secretary to record the minutes and do the filing; to be responsible for recording births, deaths, and marriages; and for communicating with the National Spiritual Assembly about address changes, enrollments, and transfers of membership.</p>
    <p>Another option is to have a three–member Secretariat including the Chair, the Secretary, and the Recording Secretary, which would assume the many secretarial duties for the Assembly. Each Assembly is free to determine the details of handling this work, the number of officers, and the responsibilities of its officers.</p>
    <p>In some communities the work of the Secretary may warrant hiring part–time or full–time staff. In such cases, the Assembly should ensure that the persons hired are trustworthy and able to maintain the Assembly’s confidentiality. The Assembly should also familiarize itself with any guidelines for state and federal hiring.</p>

    <p>
      We note in the Minutes of your meeting of ... the appointment of an Administrative Secretary
      and an Executive Secretary, whose specific areas of responsibility are defined. While there is no
      objection to the division of labour, it is our feeling that having two secretaries will be confusing to
      the friends, and we therefore suggest that your nomenclature simply be Secretary and Assistant
      Secretary.

      Re your e-mail of 12 April 1989 concerning officers of your National Spiritual Assembly, it
      is permissible for you to either elect or appoint one or more members of your Assembly to the
      position of Assistant Secretary. It is left to the discretion of the Assembly to decide which method to
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      We feel you should use the designations Secretary and Assistant Secretary for officers of
      your Secretariat, as indicated in our letter of 12 October 1971.

    <em>Secretary's Helper Can Be Non-Member of Assembly</em>
    <p>In reply to your letter of November 7th, 1973 there is no objection whatsoever to a non-member of the National Spiritual Assembly typing your Minutes or such other confidential reports. Many National Spiritual Assemblies employ typists in their national offices who are intimately connected with all the work of the National Spiritual Assembly. Of course, the person so employed should enjoy the confidence of the National Spiritual Assembly.</p>

    <h2>The Treasurer</h2>
     
    <p>The House of Justice has not established any uniform procedure for Bahá’í treasurers, since methods of accounting and the laws governing such matters vary considerably from country to country and from one situation to another. It advises that on such technical questions the National Assembly’s Treasurer can seek the advice of a professional. The National Spiritual Assembly should, of course, ensure that its books of account are audited annually and for this there is no objection to utilizing the services of a non–Bahá’í firm.</p>
    <p>In general terms, however, the House of Justice feels that there are certain matters to which National Treasurers should give particular attention.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is the relationship between the National Assembly and the individual believers and local communities. Through whatever correspondence he conducts with contributors to the National Fund and with committees which are drawing on the Fund for their work, the National Treasurer can be a powerful influence in establishing links of loving unity within the community.</li>
      <li>The Treasurer must be sure to render regular and accurate financial statements to the National Spiritual Assembly so that it can properly plan its work within the means available to it.</li>
      <li>It is the Treasurer’s responsibility to prepare the annual financial report in time for the National Spiritual Assembly to consider it before presenting it at Convention. He also has to prepare the annual budget for the consideration and approval of the National Assembly.</li>
      <li>The Treasurer should carefully monitor the use of the Fund so that he can warn the Assembly in good time if there is danger of over–spending.</li>
      <li>In bookkeeping, a system must be adopted to ensure that earmarked funds are kept absolutely distinct from those that are at the free disposition of the Assembly, and there should be safeguards to prevent the inadvertent spending of earmarked funds on matters other than those for which they are intended.</li>
      <li>In addition to keeping accurate records of income and expenditure, the Treasurer should see that the assets of the Assembly are protected and that both assets and liabilities are carefully recorded.</li>
      <li>The Treasurer should advise the Assembly to set aside sufficient sums on a regular basis to provide for the repair and maintenance of properties owned by the Faith, so that these can be kept in good condition and so that the normal work of the Cause is not interrupted by sudden requirements of large sums for repairs. Usually the task of maintaining the properties is assigned to a special committee or committees, which should be consulted by the Assembly and can suggest a suitable amount to be set aside annually.</li>
      <li>While it is within the discretion of a National Spiritual Assembly to require only one signature on checks drawn on the National Fund, experience has shown that it is better practice to require at least two signatures. This is a protection not only to the Fund itself but also to the Treasurer. The funds of the Faith are a sacred trust, and Assemblies should be meticulous in handling and accounting for them.</li>
    </ol>
    <cite>(From a letter dated 13 July 1981 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, published in Bahá’í Funds: Contributions and Administration)</cite>
    <p>The position of the Treasurer of the Local Spiritual Assembly should be thoroughly understood by everyone in the community. The duties and limits of authority may be described as follows:</p>
    <p>The Treasurer has a major responsibility in the community for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Educating the community about the funds</li>
      <li>Receiving contributions</li>
      <li>Keeping the accounts</li>
      <li>Paying the bills</li>
      <li>Spearheading budgeting process</li>
      <li>Reporting financial progress at Feasts and other gatherings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Treasurer performs these duties on behalf of the Assembly. To be effective, the Treasurer must understand that the Bahá’í Fund and, indeed, the functions of the Treasurer, are the responsibility of the entire Assembly and not just of the Treasurer alone. The Local Spiritual Assembly as a body should be concerned about the condition of the local Bahá’í Fund and consult on ways to make the community aware of the critical importance of the Fund. The Treasurer implements the decisions and policies of the Institution.</p>
    <p>The Treasurer also has a responsibility to educate the community about the role the Fund must play in attaining the primary objective of the Faith—the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth. In this regard, the functions of the office transcend material considerations. The Treasurer, as the representative of the Assembly, has the responsibility to educate and inspire the friends and emphasize the spiritual importance of the institution of the Bahá’í Fund. The friends should understand that their acts of material giving are transformed into the means of spiritual progress, not only for themselves as individuals but also for the community as a whole.</p>
    <cite>(From Developing Distinctive Bahá’í Communities: Guidelines for Spiritual Assemblies, 1998)</cite>
    
    <em>The Treasurer is Officer in Charge, but All National Spiritual Assembly Members Are Responsible</em>
    <p>The National Spiritual Assembly has the responsibility to ensure that contributions received are properly receipted, and satisfactory accounts kept of all receipts and disbursements. While the Treasurer normally is the officer in charge of such a sacred obligation, this does not mean that other members are thereby relieved of all responsibility, or are deprived of their right of access to details related to the current operation of the Assembly, in all its aspects.</p>
    <p>Such right and responsibility vested in the individual members of the Assembly do not vitiate the confidentiality of Bahá'í contributions, since the information made available to the Treasurer or other members of the Assembly is to be treated in strict confidence.</p>
    <cite>(From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly, January 11, 1977: Compilation of Extracts..., op. cit. No. 858)</cite>

    <h1>Other Matters</h1>

    
    <p>
      We assume ... that all actions of Assembly officers, taken routinely without Assembly
      consultation, will be based upon clearly stated National Assembly policies and precedents and that
      the letters will, where necessary, reflect those Assembly decisions and the authority delegated to its
      officers for such specific correspondence.

    <p>
      The Guardian welcomes the step taken by your Assembly to increasingly devote its meetings
      to the consideration of major policies and plans, and to dwell less on matters of detail and of mere
      secondary character. He would, however, urge that all decisions, unless of a trivial and insignificant
      nature dealing purely with routine work, should be reached after careful and conscientious
      deliberation by all nine members.

    <h2>Importance of Regular Attendance</h2>

    <p>It is only too obvious that unless a member can attend regularly the meetings of his local assembly, it would be impossible for him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfill his responsibilities, as a representative of the community. Membership in a Local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and capacity to remain in close touch with local Bahá'í activities, and ability to attend regularly the sessions of the assembly.</p>
    <cite>(Letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, dated February 16, 1935, to an individual believer)</cite>
    
    <p>Membership in a Bahá'í Assembly or Committee is a sacred obligation which should be gladly and confidently accepted by every loyal and conscientious member of the Community, no matter how humble and inexperienced. Once elected to serve in a given Assembly a believer's duty is to do his utmost to attend all Assembly meetings, and cooperate with his fellow-members, unless, however, he is prevented from doing so by some major reason such as illness, and even then he should notify the Assembly to this effect.</p>
    <cite>(Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, in Dawn of a New Day, p. 79)</cite>
    
    <p>In the course of reading the Minutes of National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world, the members of the Universal House of Justice have noted that in many instances Assembly meetings are attended by less than nine members. In some few cases Assemblies have difficulty in even maintaining a quorum. The House of Justice recognizes that at times a member may have a valid reason for not attending a particular meeting. However, a serious problem arises if absence is due to neglect or lack of appreciation of the sanctity of membership in an institution which is the hub and heart of Bahá'í activities in the country.</p>
    <cite>(Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, dated October 26, 1980, to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</cite>
    
    <h2>Dissatisfaction with Officers</h2>
    <p>As regards the question of what procedure the Bahá'í Assemblies should adopt when dissatisfied with the services of any of their officers, should such dissatisfaction involve the loyalty of an Assembly officer to the Faith, he should, following a majority vote, be dismissed. But in case the dissatisfaction is due to the incompetence of a member, or simply to a neglect on his part to discharge his duties, this does not constitute sufficient justification to force his resignation or dismissal from the Assembly. He should be kept in office until new elections are held.</p>
    <cite>(Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, in Principles of Bahá'í Administration, p. 50)</cite>
    
    <h2>Refusal to Serve</h2>
    <p>Concerning the question of refusal by certain believers to accept election to an administrative post: The Guardian strongly feels that criticism, opposition, or confusion do not provide sufficient grounds for either refusal or resignation. Only cases of physical or mental incapacity, which, by their very nature, are extremely rare, constitute valid reasons for such an act. The difficulties and tests involved in the acceptance of administrative posts, far from inducing the believers to dissociate themselves from the work of the Cause, should spur them on to greater exertions and to a more active participation in the privileged task of resolving the problems that confront the Bahá'í community. . . . The believers, for the sake of the Cause, now in the period of its infancy, should accept their duties in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and should be animated by the desire to uphold the verdict of the electorate, and to lend their share of assistance, however difficult the circumstances, to the effective administration of the affairs of the Faith.</p>
    <cite>(Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, in Bahá'í News, #152, April 1942, p. 2)</cite>
    
    <p>While it is true that refusal to serve can ultimately incur the forfeiture of administrative rights, the House of Justice feels that your Assembly should bear in mind the caution voiced on behalf of the Guardian in the letter published on pages 86 and 87 of Principles of Bahá'í Administration: "Only in cases where individual believers, without any valid reason, deliberately refuse the repeated exhortations, pleas, and warnings addressed to them by their Assemblies, should action be taken in removing them from the voting list." At the present stage . . . far more beneficial results are likely to be achieved by encouragement of the believers and by their education in the principles and significance of Bahá'í administration than by the threat or imposition of sanctions. Indeed the latter, if applied unwisely, could achieve the very opposite of what your Assembly is hoping to accomplish.</p>
    <p>Generally the membership of small local communities includes some believers who are new in the Faith and need to be lovingly nurtured in the responsibilities of being a Bahá'í, and others who are overburdened by a multitude of cares. How often one finds in small Assemblies members who, although devoted believers, have non-Bahá'í spouses and families to care for and are very limited in the time they can spend in Bahá'í administrative activities. Such believers should be encouraged, and loving appreciation should be shown for whatever services they can render, and nothing should be done, however unintentionally, to make them feel that they are living under a threat of administrative expulsion if they do not attend every Assembly meeting or decline a request to serve on a committee.</p>
    <p>There may, of course, be cases of believers who, without any good reason, refuse to shoulder the responsibilities of membership in the Bahá'í community. It is to such extreme cases that you would be justified in applying sanctions if, after "repeated exhortations, pleas and warnings" they persist in their attitude.</p>
    <cite>(Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, dated July 8, 1980, to a National Spiritual Assembly)</cite>
    
    <em>Obligation of a Bahá'í Who is Elected to an Office which Requires Full-Time Service</em>
    <p>The Universal House of Justice has received your letter mailed 23rd January, 1987 concerning the obligation of a Bahá'í who is elected to an office which requires full-time service. We are asked to share with you an excerpt of a letter dated 7th August 1980 written on behalf of the House of Justice addressed to an individual believer facing a problem similar to the one you pose.</p>
    <p class="quote">
      The delicate balance between the claims of the Cause of God and the claims of one's profession is an intensely personal matter which can only be resolved eventually in the heart and soul of each individual. Many Bahá'ís have become, and are, distinguished in their professions and at the same time have rendered and are rendering great services to the Cause and it is obviously possible to
      achieve distinction in one's profession and calling and to serve the Cause of God at the same time. The House of Justice realizes, however, that circumstances can conspire, at critical times in the fortunes of the Faith, to require individuals to make the heart-searching decision of sacrificing one's own prospects for the apparent good of the Cause. Here again, the history of the Cause provides many examples of believers who have willingly foregone promotion in, or even the continued practice of, their professions in order to meet the needs of the Faith. As in all difficult decisions facing individual believers, the God-given process of consultation is available to them, and every individual may consult either one of the institutions of the Faith or an individual officer, such as a Counsellor or Board member, or even one or two friends of his own choosing. Even then, however, the eventual decisions rests with the individual himself.
